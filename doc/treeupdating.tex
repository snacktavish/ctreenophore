\title{Rapidly updating large trees with new taxa}
\author{Emily Jane McTavish}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Using EPA to generate starting trees for RaxML}

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Start with tree with branch lengths and query sequence (binary tree for RaxML?)
 \item Run EPA for quesry placements
 \item Take enough trees to encompass 90\% posterior placement probabilty 
 \item Run RaxML with each of those as starting trees
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{subproblems}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item[] Alignment uncertainty Does pagan scale? appears not. Profile alignements make most sense.. options?
\end{enumerate}


\section{Using PLL to compare likelihoods at nodes across a set of possible placements to divide and conquer}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item[Inputs] a set of trees generated by EPA from a large tree and a query sequence, and the alignment
 \item[Likelihood calculations] Compare vectors of site likelihoods at nodes (or conditional reconstruction probailities?) to determine region of tree where placement of query taxon matters
 \item[] Output : The branch in the orginial tree where additional taxon stops affecting likelihoods
 \item[] Subtree search : Perfom full ML search on subtree of that branch which includes query sequence
 \item[] Graft tree back together, rinse, repeat.
\end{enumerate}

\section{To do}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Script Alignment EPA part in python
 \item Talk to Diego about PLL possibilites
 \item Find good dataset?
 \item Compare placing 5 taxa and searching to adding one 1 and searching each time...
\end{enumerate}
